Upload this text file for encryption!!
This file will be encrypted using an LFSR-based FSM.
If you can read this after decryption, then the system works!

NOTE: 
After decryption, the output file will still have the .enc extension.
➤ To properly view or use the file after decryption, change the extension back to its original format (e.g., .txt, .pdf, .jpg, etc.).

To successfully decrypt a file, you must use the exact same seed that was used during encryption.
➤ If the wrong seed is provided, the output will be corrupted or unreadable.
