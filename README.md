# Stream Cipher (FSM-Based) â€“ Verilog â†’ C++ â†’ Flask Demo

- Started with a Verilog-based stream cipher, using:

	-> a basic Finite State Machine (FSM)

	-> and an LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) for pseudo-randomness

- Converted the same logic into C++ to simulate the FSM behavior in software

- Built a simple Flask web interface to demonstrate encryption/decryption in an interactive way

The webpage is just for demonstration purposes!!

## What This Project Shows

- I built a basic FSM in **Verilog** that drives a stream cipher.
- Converted the FSM logic to **C++** using the same LFSR-based PRNG idea.
- Wrapped it all in a **Flask web app** so anyone can test encryption/decryption locally.
- It's just for demonstration â€” not a real-world encryption tool.

## ðŸ§° Tools and Tech Used

- `Verilog` â€“ FSM and LFSR logic
- `C++` â€“ Core cipher engine (same behavior as FSM)
- `Python + Flask` â€“ Web interface for local testing
- `HTML/CSS` â€“ Simple front-end
